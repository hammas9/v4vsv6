\section{Censorship by Resource Record Types} \label{sec:resources}

\para{Overview.}
In this section, we focus on {\it identifying and characterizing differences in
the handling of IPv4 and IPv6 resource records} in DNS censorship deployments.
Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions: 
%
(\Cref{sec:resources:sig}) is the censorship of IPv4 resource records (DNS
{\tt A} queries) significantly different than the censorship of IPv6 resource
records (DNS {\tt AAAA} queries)?,
%
(\Cref{sec:resources:domains}) what are the characteristics of domains in which
these differences are frequently observed?, and
%
(\Cref{sec:resources:resolvers}) what are the characteristics of the resolvers
which frequently exhibit such differences?

\subsection{Quantifying differences in the censorship of \texttt{A} and
\texttt{AAAA} resource records} \label{sec:resources:sig}
%
We use the responses received from our {\tt A} and {\tt AAAA} queries sent to
the same set of resolvers and for the same set of domains (\cf
\Cref{sec:methods:gathering} for a detailed description of our data gathering
process). We then apply the censorship determination methods described in
\Cref{sec:methods:labeling} to measure the prevalence of censorship on our {\tt
A} and {\tt AAAA} DNS queries. Finally, we perform statistical tests to
identify significant differences in the prevalence of censorship of {\tt A} and
{\tt AAAA} queries within a country, by individual resolvers, and for each
domain. 

\para{Identifying differences within a country.} 
To measure differences in DNS query handling within a specific country, we
compare the prevalence of censorship on {\tt A} and {\tt AAAA} queries by
aggregating responses across {each resolver within the country}. This presents
us with a two distributions (one each for the group of {\tt A} and {\tt AAAA}
queries) of the fraction of censored domains observed from resolvers in the
country.
%
We use a $t$-test to verify statistical significance of any observed
differences between the two groups for each country. In our statistical
analysis, we aim to achieve a significance level of 5\% ($p \leq$  .05)
\emph{over all our findings}. Therefore, we apply a Sidak correction
\cite{Sidak} to control for Type I errors from multiple hypothesis testing. 
%
This requires $p \leq 1-{.05}^{1/n_{c}}$ for classifying a difference as
significant, where $n_c$ is the total number of countries in our dataset
(\fixme{XXX}). This approach reduces the likelihood of false-positive reports
of within-country differences.
%
The presence of a statistically significant difference for a specific country
would imply that the two resource types appear to undergo different censorship
mechanisms within that country (or, a significant number of resolvers within
that country have inconsistencies in their handling of each query type).

\para{Identifying differences in individual resolvers.} 
To measure differences in DNS query handling of individual resolvers, we
compare the ratios of censored responses observed from our {\tt A} and {\tt
AAAA} queries {from each resolver}.  
%
We use a two-proportion $z$-test to verify the statistical significance of any
observed difference in the ratios between the two groups for each resolver.
Similar to our within-country analysis, we apply a Sidak correction to account
for our testing of multiple hypotheses and use $p \leq 1-{.05}^{1/n_r}$ to
classify a difference as significant, where $n_r$ is the total number of
resolvers in our dataset (\fixme{XXX}).
%
In the absence of significant within-country differences, the presence of
a statistically significant difference for a resolver would imply that the two
resource types appear to undergo different censorship mechanisms due to
resolver misconfiguration.

\para{Identifying differences in domain behaviors within a country.} 
To uncover the domains which have their {\tt A} and {\tt AAAA} queries treated
differently within a country, we compare the ratios of censored responses in
each group for each domain across all resolvers within a country.  
%
We use a two-proportion $z$-test to verify the statistical significance of any
observed differences between the two query types for each domain tested within
each country. We once again apply a Sidak correction to ensure that our results
for domains identified to behave differently within each country are within
a 5\% significance level. We set $p \leq 1-{.05}^{1/n_{dom_{c}}}$, where
$n_{dom_{c}}$ represents the number of domains tested in country $c$.
%
In the absence of significant within-country differences, a statistically
significant difference for a domain would suggest the presence of
a domain-specific characteristic that results in the two resource records
undergoing different censorship mechanisms within the corresponding country.
