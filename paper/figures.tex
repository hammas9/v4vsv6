%         We measured the number of epochs that were necessary for an attacker to
%         uniquely determine who was messaging a pre-selected victim, Bob, under
%         sealed sender assuming every message was ``immediately'' replied to with
%         a \textit{delivery receipt}. We found that the graph structure had no
%         influence on the effectiveness of the attack. We ran the attack 100
%         times for each user base size and found that with a user base of
%         1,000,000 on average Bob needed to receive 6.5 message from the same
%         user in order to deanonymize the conversation between the sender (Alice)
%         and Bob.
